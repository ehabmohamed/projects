## [YouTube-8M Video Understanding Video Multi-Label Classification using Deep Learning and Decision Trees Methods](https://github.com/ehabmohamed/projects/blob/master/MSDS/Data%20Science%20-%20Final%20Project%20Presentation.pdf) (MS in Data Science Final Project Presentation)
The project aims to predict video label(s) using the YouTube-8M dataset by implementing both Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and Mixture of Experts (MoE), as well as, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) with Binary Relevance transformation.

DNN and MoE are examined by tuning different parameters (i.e., no. of mixture of experts for MoE, no. of layers and neurons for DNN, regularization factor, learning rate, dropout keeping rate, and no. of steps).

The best score (Global Average Precision 0.809) was formed by averaging both the DNN and MoE best models. Whereas, the XGB did not perform well and the implementation of the binary relevance may be revised to ensure its feasibility.

## [The role of Social Media in influencing consumer purchasing decision - Case Study of Automobile Industry in Saudi Arabia](https://github.com/ehabmohamed/projects/blob/master/MBA/MBA%20-%20Final%20Presentation.pdf) (MBA Final Project Presentation)
The project aims to study the role of social media in influencing consumer purchasing decision and focuses on the automobile industry in Saudi Arabia.

The findings show that most of consumers trust user-generated rather than firm-created social media. Although brands have their own social media channels which are under their control, consumers prefer independent social media channels that have features which brands do not have.

Social media successful characteristics and features which attract consumers are already operating independently. This causes a gap between what brands publish and what consumers receive from independent resources.

To decrease this gap, brands are required to penetrate these independent social media channels and interact directly with consumers. However, the reasons behind the current gap and the consequences of this penetration may worth a further research in future studies.
