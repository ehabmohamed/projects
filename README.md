## [The role of Social Media in influencing consumer purchasing decision - Case Study of Automobile Industry in Saudi Arabia](https://github.com/ehabmohamed/projects/blob/master/MSDS/Data%20Science%20-%20Final%20Project%20Presentation.pdf) (MBA Final Project Presentation)
The project aims to study the role of social media in influencing consumer purchasing decision and focuses on the automobile industry in Saudi Arabia.

The findings show that most of consumers trust user-generated rather than firm-created social media. Although brands have their own social media channels which are under their control, consumers prefer independent social media channels that have features which brands do not have.

Social media successful characteristics and features which attract consumers are already operating independently. This causes a gap between what brands publish and what consumers receive from independent resources.

To decrease this gap, brands are required to penetrate these independent social media channels and interact directly with consumers. However, the reasons behind the current gap and the consequences of this penetration may worth a further research in future studies.
