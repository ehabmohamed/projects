## [YouTube-8M Video Understanding Video Multi-Label Classification using Deep Learning and Decision Trees Methods](https://github.com/ehabmohamed/projects/blob/master/MSDS/Data%20Science%20-%20Final%20Project%20Presentation.pdf) (MS in Data Science Final Project Presentation)
The project aims to predict video label(s) using the YouTube-8M dataset by implementing both Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and Mixture of Experts (MoE), as well as, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) with Binary Relevance transformation.

DNN and MoE are examined by tuning different parameters (i.e., no. of mixture of experts for MoE, no. of layers and neurons for DNN, regularization factor, learning rate, dropout keeping rate, and no. of steps).

The best score (Global Average Precision 0.809) was formed by averaging both the DNN and MoE best models. Whereas, the XGB did not perform well and the implementation of the binary relevance may be revised to ensure its feasibility.

## [Sentiment Analysis using Bage-of-Words Approach](https://github.com/ehabmohamed/projects/blob/master/SentimentAnalysis/SentimentAnalysis.ipynb)

## [TV News Channel Commercial Detection](https://github.com/ehabmohamed/projects/blob/master/ImageClassifier/ImageClassifier.ipynb)
The project aims to automatically detect commercials in TV news videos.

Four supervised machine learning models are examined to predict whether a TV news video shot is a commercial or not. 

The four algorithms are Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, Random Forests and Gradient Boosting Classifier.

A set of news video shots is used for training and testing the machine learning models.

The performance results of the Neural Network model show the highest prediction accuracy of 93.13%.

## [Internet Advertisements Prediction](https://github.com/ehabmohamed/projects/blob/master/InternetAdsPredictor/InternetAdsPredictor.ipynb)
The project aims to recognize the advertisement images shown in web pages. Two supervised machine learning algorithms are used to predict whether the image shown in a web page is an advertisement or not.

The two algorithms are Random Forests and Gradient Boosting Classifier.

A set of possible advertisements on internet pages is used for training and testing the machine learning models.

The performance results of both algorithms show a high prediction accuracy of 97%.

# Business Studies
## [The role of Social Media in influencing consumer purchasing decision - Case Study of Automobile Industry in Saudi Arabia](https://github.com/ehabmohamed/projects/blob/master/MBA/MBA%20-%20Final%20Presentation.pdf) (MBA Final Project Presentation)
The project aims to study the role of social media in influencing consumer purchasing decision and focuses on the automobile industry in Saudi Arabia.

The findings show that most of consumers trust user-generated rather than firm-created social media. Although brands have their own social media channels which are under their control, consumers prefer independent social media channels that have features which brands do not have.

Social media successful characteristics and features which attract consumers are already operating independently. This causes a gap between what brands publish and what consumers receive from independent resources.

To decrease this gap, brands are required to penetrate these independent social media channels and interact directly with consumers. However, the reasons behind the current gap and the consequences of this penetration may worth a further research in future studies.

## [H&M Strategic Management Plan](https://github.com/ehabmohamed/projects/blob/master/MBA/H%26M%20Strategic%20Management%20Plan.pdf)
The study aims to:
- Analyze H&M customer target, position and core value. 
- Perform business audit to identify H&M’s operation model, activity system map, core activities associated with their costs and resources, strength and weakness, and strategic importance.
- Identify H&M’s internal and external linkages.
- Develop the management agenda to operate in a new location (Dubai Festival City Mall).

## [Country Risk Assessment for Construction Firms](https://github.com/ehabmohamed/projects/blob/master/MBA/Country%20Risk%20Assessment.pdf)
The study aims to:
- Assess the risk associated with operating a construction firm in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, United Arab of Emirates. 
- Identify economic, financial, and political risks for each country.
-	Highlight risk ratings provided by the International Country Risk Guide (ICRG) for each country.
-	Develop a risk register including the proposed mitigation action for each country.
